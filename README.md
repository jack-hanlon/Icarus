# Summary
<div style="text-align: justify"> NASA produces a variety of surface solar and meteorological data parameters that are useful to commercial renewable energy and sustainable building ventures, but this information is not easily accessible to the typical homeowner. Your challenge is to develop a mobile application to access the information on NASAâ€™s Prediction of Worldwide renewable Energy Resources (POWER) web services portal and provide useful information about sunshine to the general public.</div>

# Background
Solar energy is more widespread in some countries than others, and it is the fastest growing and most affordable source of new electricity in the United States according to the U.S. Department of Energy (https://www.energy.gov/solar).  
NASA produces a variety of surface solar and meteorological data parameters that are useful to commercial renewable energy and sustainable building ventures. Parameters key to siting, sizing, and monitoring these technologies are available via NASA's Prediction of Worldwide renewable Energy Resources (POWER) web services portal.  
These parameters are developed by NASA Earth observation analysis and modeling efforts undertaken by organizations such as the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) project and the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office. However, the POWER web site is not streamlined or simplified for use by the general public due to the vast number of parameters, time averages, and statistical reports available.
